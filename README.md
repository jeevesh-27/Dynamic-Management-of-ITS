# Dynamic-Management-of-ITS
The project focuses on dynamic management of ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) resources during emergency situations including medical attention, fire sites, disaster-affected locations, etc.
ITS can efficiently aid in the process of the allocation of ambulances in case of a medical emergency considering different constraints such as congestion, route, distance, etc. in a timely manner.
Proposed solutions for the above problem will be achieved by implementing different algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s and constraint optimization algorithms on an existing framework based on the transportation system.
